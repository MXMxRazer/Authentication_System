# Authentication_System

## NOTE: CHECKOUT THE SECONDARY BRANCHES, NOT STORED IN MAIN BRANCH.

Authentication System through JWT tokens using NestJS (Framework Inspired by Spring-Boot) and NextJS.

# NOTE: IT IS MADE IN NESTJS, A FRAMEWORK THAT IS EXTREMELY SIMILAR TO SPRING FRAMEWORK AND USES ALL THE CONCEPT OF SPRING. IT HOWEVER IS RELATIVELY NEW FRAMEWORK AND STILL HAS SOME ISSUES. 

# What it does: 

It is an authentication mechanicsm created to satisfy the modern login services to the client into a system. It works on the basis of JWT tokens. 

When user enter's their correct username/email and password, then the backend api fires a service to create jwt tokens that then is sent to the client for the validation, if the user is authenticated to the application or not.  

# Technologies Used:

1. NestJS.
2. NextJS.
3. JWT Token.
4. Sessions.
5. Web Development Tool Set.
